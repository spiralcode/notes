Count, this is the first one !.  And I'm overwhelmed, of this Love, which would make us to spend the rest of all our Birthdays together. After some years, we would have so many birthdays to celeberate, of our Kids, but then also there will be you, who loves me lot and whom I love, who's gonna get all my kisses in her birthday.
